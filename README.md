# CS-330-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

  Approaching software degign involves a combination of creativity, problem-solving, and attention to user needs. It begins with understanding the purpose and scope of the software being developed as well as identifying user requirements and conceptualizing potential solutions. My work on this project has honed my ability to think critically about user experience, anticipate potential challenges, and iterate on design solutions based on feedback from the professor. Throughout this process, I have learned the importance of prototyping and incorporating feedback loops to refine my design. 
  For development, having a structured approach is important. Breaking down the project into manageable tasks and prioritizing them is included in the process. In my 3D scene project, I adopted strategies such as modular programming to maintain code quality and manage complexity effectively. Iteration played a role in refining features and addressing bugs throughout the development cycle. My approach to developing code has evolved through milestones, emphasizing the importance of code organization, documentation, and collaboration.
  Computer science provides me the technical foundation for software development, giving me problem-solving skills and analytical thinking which are both essential for tackling complex problems in developing software. Computational graphics and visualizations offer insights into computational thinking. This skill opens doors for me to various pathways in my eduation and career. These include game development, virtual reality, data visualization, and computer-aided design where visual communication and problem-solving are paramount.
